# BasicDjangoWebsite
In this project i went using backend development with django framework with python to make a basic website about sales and customers. Languages that were used were Html, css, Python, and Javascript. This is the setup to make data with sales in this example. This project will be changed and improved later on. 
Majority of this project was in python, don't know why it says most of it was in js.
